# Map Location Keys

![Map Location Keys](img/hero.png)

With this extension you can add "location keys" to a map, which usually contain descriptions of a particular room or feature.

Location Keys can be kept private to the GM or shared with players using the player visibility feature.

You only need to add a text item to the map, ideally one or two characters long, eg: 1, 5a, B2, etc.

Then using the context menu you can add it to the Location Keys. Now, using the drawer menu you can see a default description has been added for that item, but you can edit it as you like.

The description supports Markdown and there are Import/Export features for handling several locations at a time. You can also add player-specific information and control which location keys are visible to players.

The idea here is to reduce tab switching between OBR and wherever your map descriptions are. With a little prep you can add the descriptions to OBR, ideally in a summarised form, and have a smoother experience.

## Player Visibility Features

**NEW:** GMs can now share location information with players!

### GM Controls

- Add custom "Player Information" content when editing location keys
- Toggle player visibility via context menu, edit form, or GM view buttons  
- Visual indicators show which location keys are shared with players

### Player Experience

- Players see only location keys marked as player-visible
- Custom player-friendly descriptions (supports Markdown)
- Navigate to locations using "Show" buttons
- Clean interface focused on shared information

This feature allows GMs to selectively share location details while keeping private GM notes separate.
